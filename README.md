# Fives and Ones

### Matteo Golin

Fives and Ones is a simple dice game known by many names (such as [Dice 10000][dice-10000]). This program aims to
provide the winner with the statistically best moves to play Fives and Ones.

**I am not a statistician! Do not use this program to gamble!**

## Usage

This is a CLI program which requires you to provide your current roll (since the first roll is played the same way
regardless).

Pass the program the face value of all 6 dice in your current roll using `fao <dice>`. Order does not matter.

For example:

```console
$ fao 1 1 2 6 5 4

...some statistcal breakdown; in progress...
```
